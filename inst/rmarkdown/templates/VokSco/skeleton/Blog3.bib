	abstract = {This paper explores the assertion that much of clinical diagnostic thinking is based on the rapid and unconscious matching of the presenting problem to a similar, previously encountered, problem. This ‘non-analytic’ form of concept formation has been described in the psychology literature for over a decade. From this theory, we deduce and test several hypotheses: 1) Diagnosis is based in part on similarity to a particular previous example. In studies in dermatology, specific similarity accounts for about 30\% of diagnosis. 2) When experts err, these errors are as likely as novices to occur on typical presentations. For residents, general practitioners and dermatologists, about 40\% of errors were on typical slides. 3) Features are re-interpreted in light of diagnostic hypotheses. In radiology, attaching a standard positive history to the film bag increased the number of features seen on both normal and abnormal films by about 50\%. 4) Experts cannot predict errors of other experts. In dermatology, experts predicted only 11–60\% of errors committed by their colleagues. We conclude that amassing prior instances is an important component of expertise, and education should recognize this element.},

	shorttitle = {Nonanalytic {Cognition}},
	abstract = {This chapter presents evidence that challenges major points in the usual, divergent treatment of perception, categorization, and episodic memory. Perceptual and categorical processing cannot be assumed to depend on high-level units that change only over many trials and that are relatively independent of context. The effect of attentive processing need not be the systematically discarded information about surface characteristics; many perceptual and conceptual judgments depend upon nominally irrelevant information about a source and format. Both generalizing and explicitly episodic memory tasks can be accomplished in several ways. The analytic extreme, emphasized in a usual cognitive framework, depends solely on relevant information. A nonanalytic procedure depends on tightly integrated combinations of relevant and irrelevant information. Perceptual identification and conceptual judgments are no less variable or context dependent than explicit memory for episodes. The chapter discusses the effects on perception and categorization of manipulations that have traditionally been employed in investigations of explicit episodic memory tasks.},
